# AGENTS.md

## Repository expectations
- This is a TypeScript/Node monorepo.
- Use `pnpm` for dependencies.

## Review guidelines
- When reviewing a pull request, check the top-level `README.md` file.
- Identify its first markdown heading (the line starting with `# `).
- If that heading is not written entirely in uppercase letters:
  - Leave a PR comment (summary comment is fine) with a warning.
  - The comment should clearly state that the README title should be fully uppercase.
